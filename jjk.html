        No pacing issues here. Jujutsu Kaisen introduces its large number of characters, establishes the Jujutsu world, and explains the power system without it feeling abrupt and out of place. Every element is given enough time, characters are fleshed out nicely, and even the story is set up smoothly for future seasons.

        While Satoru Gojou, Yuji Itadori, and Megumi Fushigoro are obviously fleshed out given they’re the main male characters in a shonen anime—the show gets female characters like Nobara Kugisaki, Maki and Mai Zenin right too—making them some much-needed competent female characters.

        The show will make sure to get belly laughs out of you as it finds the right balance between action and comedy. Yuji is a hilarious protagonist whose antics never let him get stale as a shonen main character. However, Jujutsu Kaisen isn’t afraid to go dark either. The world has a horror feel to it as it is full of monsters and supernatural entities.

        Produced by Studio MAPPA which worked on the latter seasons of Attack on Titan, Jujutsu Kaisen offers fluid motions in fight scenes and smooth animations even when you would normally expect a studio to cut corners for a TV show. The show doesn’t hold back even on character expressions, making them feel alive.
